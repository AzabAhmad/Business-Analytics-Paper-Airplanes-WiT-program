# Renting Bike System
This is my final project as part of Business Analytics training in WiT program at Paper Airplanes.

Project Abstract:

As seeking to leave the ground with an alternatively sustained less time-consuming methodology without being environmentally marginalized rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort thus providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern.
The Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set was chosen to analyze renting bike system. The data set contains the count of public bikes rented at each hour in Seoul Bike haring System with the corresponding Weather data and Holidays information.
The main goal was to suggest a linear regression model and check out if our model is better than intercept only model. For doing so, the relationship between weather patterns (temperature, wind speed, and humidity) and the demand for renting bikes was studied. For more details feel free to check out the project files on GitHub.
